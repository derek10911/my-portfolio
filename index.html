        <h2>I'm Derek Caceres</h2>
        <h1>Software Developer</h1>
        <p class="p-color">My favorite thing about programming is that, It enables me to undestand the functunal logic and information behind
            websites, programs, etc, being build worldwide now a days. As a forex trader I have been working with programs built in the past
            by multiple traders and programmers. Algorithms and programs are now being used every single day to analize the foreign exchange market in the world and others.

        <h3>My Projects</h3>
        <p class="p-color">Coming soon.</p>
        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p class="p-color">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Corrupti ut saepe perspiciatis maxime et exercitationem rem omnis est, libero porro deleniti sed provident eius quis aperiam perferendis assumenda obcaecati non.</p>
        
        <h3><a href="./contact.html" id="S-color">Click here to contact me!</a></h3>

	<!-- 
	  Directions:
		1. Create a DIV element to contain the page content.
		2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text.
		3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text, "Software Developer."
		4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag, which will make a horizontal line.
		5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______.")
		
        6. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects."
		7. Create a paragraph tag that says "Coming Soon."
		8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me."
		9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. HINT: You will need to do a search for this text...it is long! Alternatively, grab a sample from this site: https://generator.lorem-ipsum.info/

		BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early.
		  - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/).
		  - Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me," a paragraph tag containing your email, and a paragraph tag containing your phone number (these can be fake!).
